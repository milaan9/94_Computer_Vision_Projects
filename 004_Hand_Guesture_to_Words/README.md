# Hand_Guesture_to_Words
Reads your hand signs and translates them to English words using Tensorflow object detection API<br>
The model is built using transfer learning from pretrained model ssd_mobilenet model<br>
The dataset is made manually by running the __*Image Collection python file*__ that collects images from your webcam for all the mentioned below signs in the American Sign Language :<br>
* Hello ✋
* I Love You 💙
* Thank you 😺
* Please 🥺
